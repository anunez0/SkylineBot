# SkylineBot

The project description is in [this link](https://github.com/gebakx/SkylineBot) (Catalan).

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Open a console and `cd` to the directory where you extracted the source code.

2. Run

    ```bash
    > pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    to install the libraries the bot uses.

3. Save in a `token.txt` file your *access token*, which looks like `U10201543:AAHdqTcvCH1vGWJxfSeofSAs0K5PALDsaw`.

4. The executable file called `bot.py` allows you to run the bot using the command:

    ```bash
    > python bot.py
    ```
